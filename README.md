# Credit Scoring Model Implementation
A scoring model to predict the probability of a client's bankruptcy

## Introduction
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.<br/>
"Prêt à depenser", a French financial company, strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. <br/>
In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, "Prêt à depenser" makes use of a variety of alternative data (including telco and transactional information) to predict their clients' repayment abilities.<br/>
While "Prêt à depenser" is currently using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions, they're challenging us to help them unlock the full potential of their data.<br/>
Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.<br/>

## Model training methodology
1- Describe dataset<br/>
2- Clean and optimize data (Kernel Kaggle)<br/>
3- Manage data imbalance (Smote/ NearMiss)<br/>
4- Find the best model, train and optimize it (XGBoost)<br/>
5- Interpret the model (SHAP)<br/>
6- Create the dashboard and deploy it (Streamlit)<br/>
